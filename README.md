# dotfiles

To install the whole setup :
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/groovykiwi/dotfiles/
cd dotfiles
chmod +x packages config
./packages

```

It will ask you to run the config script once all the packages are installed. However, you can run it manually if you want a special type of install. Check `./config -h`

All the dotfiles are symlinked to the ~/dotfiles folder for an easy management.

The install scripts are made to be ran on a fresh install of Manjaro i3 Edition but should work fine on any Arch based system.
